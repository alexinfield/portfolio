# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

This repository now includes a custom GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to ensure reliable deployment to GitHub Pages.

## What was fixed

- **Queue Issues**: The custom workflow includes concurrency controls to prevent deployment queue conflicts
- **Reliability**: Two-stage build and deploy process with validation steps
- **Error Handling**: Built-in checks for required files and HTML validation
- **Manual Control**: Can be manually triggered from the Actions tab if needed

## How it works

1. **Triggers**: The workflow runs on:
   - Pushes to the main branch
   - Manual dispatch from GitHub Actions tab
   - Pull request merges to main

2. **Build Stage**:
   - Validates HTML files
   - Checks for required files (index.html, .nojekyll)
   - Prepares artifacts for deployment

3. **Deploy Stage**:
   - Deploys to GitHub Pages
   - Verifies deployment success
   - Provides deployment URL

## Features

- **Concurrency Control**: Prevents multiple deployments from running simultaneously
- **Error Prevention**: Validates files before deployment
- **Deployment Verification**: Confirms successful deployment
- **Manual Trigger**: Can be run manually for troubleshooting

## Repository Configuration

The repository is already configured with:
- `.nojekyll` file to disable Jekyll processing
- Proper directory structure for static site deployment
- Relative paths compatible with GitHub Pages project URLs

## Next Steps

1. Merge this PR to main branch
2. The workflow will automatically run and deploy the site
3. Check the Actions tab to verify successful deployment
4. Visit the GitHub Pages URL to confirm the site is working
